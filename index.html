    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4lnZr022M8">An unforgettable luncheon</a>
    <p>CHALMERS: Well, Seymour, I made it... despite your directions.<p>
<p>SKINNER: Ah, Superintendent Chalmers! Welcome! I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon!</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Uhh... </p>
<p>SKINNER: [gasp] Oh egads, my roast is ruined! But what if... I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking?</p>
<p>[to himself] Oh ho ho ho ho... delightfully devilish, Seymour!</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Uh-</p>
<p>[cue song]</p>
<p>Skinner with his crazy explanations,<br>
The superintendent's gonna need his medication,<br>
When he hears Skinner's lame exaggerations,<br>
There'll be trouble in town tonight!<br>
[end of song]</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Seymour!</p>
<p>SKINNER: Superintendent, I was just, uh... just stretching my calves on the windowsill. Isometric exercise! Care to join me?</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour?</p>
<p>SKINNER: Uhh... no! That isn't smoke. It's steam. Steam from the steamed clams we're having! Mmm... steamed clams! [beat] Ooh...</p>
<p>[a few moments later]</p>
<p>SKINNER: Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouthwatering hamburgers!</p>
<p>CHALMERS: I thought we were having steamed clams.</p>
<p>SKINNER: D'oh, no. I said steamed hams! That's what I call hamburgers!</p>
<p>CHALMERS: You call hamburgers "steamed hams?"</p>
<p>SKINNER: Yes. It's a regional dialect!</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Uh-huh... uh, what region?</p>
<p>SKINNER: Uhh... upstate New York?</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Really? Well, I'm from Utica, and I've never heard anyone use the phrase "steamed hams."</p>
<p>SKINNER: Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression.</p>
<p>CHALMERS: I see. [beat] You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.</p>
<p>SKINNER: Oh ho ho ho... no, patented Skinner burgers. Old family recipe.</p>
<p>CHALMERS: For steamed hams?</p>
<p>SKINNER: Yes.</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Yeah, so you call them "steamed hams" despite the fact they are obviously grilled.</p>
<p>SKINNER: Ye- hey- you know, the- one thing I should- excuse me for one second</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Of course.</p>
<p>SKINNER: [YAWN] Well, that was wonderful. A good time was had by all, I'm pooped.</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Yes, I should be- Good Lord, what is happening in there!?</p>
<p>SKINNER: Aurora borealis?</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Uh- aurora borealis!? At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen!?</p>
<p>SKINNER: Yes!</p>
<p>CHALMERS: May I see it?</p>
<p>SKINNER: No.</p>
<p>SKINNER'S MOTHER: Seymour, the house is on fire!</p>
<p>SKINNER: No, motherâ€”it's just the northern lights!</p>
<p>CHALMERS: Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say... you steam a good ham.</p>
<p>SKINNER'S MOTHER: Help! Help!</p>
